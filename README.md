# RecyclerView-And-CardView-Example

Recycling is one of those things that is good for the planet, 
and it’s an common sense way to make sure we don’t find ourselves buried in our own rubbish or without sufficient resources in the future.
A few Android engineers thought about the benefits of recycling and realized that an OS can also run more efficiently if it recycles. 
The result of this inspiration was millions of eco-Warriors and recycling enthusiasts rejoicing when the RecyclerView widget was introduced into Android Lollipop — or something like that. :]
There was even more celebration when Google announced a support library to make this clean, green, recycling machine backwards compatible all the way to Android Eclair (2.2), which was released back in 2010!
